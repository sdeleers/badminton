# Automated notifications for booking badminton courts
Project date: 2019

Booking badminton courts in Leuven is hard since the demand is greater than the supply. Booking courts is done online with reservations becoming available at a random time each week, to avoid queues of people booking all at the same time. I made a small script that periodically polled the web server and notified me via email whenever reservations could be made for that week.
